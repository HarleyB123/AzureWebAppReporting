# AzureWebAppReporting
Report on webapps in Azure and pushes the data to a log aggregator.

To get started - fill in your client_id, secret and tenant in main.py and your log aggregator customer_id and shared_key in aggregation.py

**NOTE that this script can take a while if you have a large amount of app services, it is best run in a pipeline on Azure DevOps**
